## Who We Are

New Coyote Consulting is a people-first equity and communications consulting firm serving QTBIPOC professionals and their organizations as they come into their power. After beginning an equity journey, many organizations find that old ways of messaging and management don’t line up with their current vision. New Coyote starts and leads with equity. With services ranging from training to strategy to content creation, we help our clients craft and support a communications strategy that makes money while centering their principles and core values.

Check out our website at [newcoyote.com](https://newcoyote.com/) to learn more about who we are and what we do.

New Coyote became a certified benefit company in January of 2021.


## Our Mission

At the core of our work is the principle that capitalism and colonialism are both rooted in white supremacy, made to extract value from the working class in order to preserve and increase wealth for the ultra rich. Because this understanding permeates everything we do, this foundational issue and the liberation practice we cultivate to address it must be accounted for in all our actions, both as individuals and as organizations.

Liberation practice starts internally. We can’t tell clients they need to resist toxic colonizer mindsets if we ourselves aren’t doing the necessary work and having that practice show up for us in our day to day. At New Coyote, the preferred workday length is 6 hours or fewer, but never any more. If we need more hours, we bring on more people. We break for breakfast, lunch and dinner if those meals are lining up with our working hours. We pay everyone a minimum of market median plus 10%, and we focus on work that gets results rather than work that checks boxes. In the state of Oregon, it is considered fraud for a company our size to provide health insurance, so we offer a merit raise of $3/hr to help offset the cost of insurance for our employees.

We prioritize clients who are transgender or gender nonconforming people and Black, Indigenous or other people of color, especially where we can help people grow into and express their power.

## In Closing

2022 was one of the most turbulent years I've experienced in business. It’s the year we thought we were going to have to close, and I now find myself reflecting on how far we’ve come. Despite the fact that we hired our first employee in January 2022, and felt confident about our future, a couple months later—due to myriad influences, some of which were out of our control—we were planning and measuring week-to-week whether we could keep our doors open.

One of our major strengths as a business is that we’re extremely innovative and adaptable. In order to get out of the deep hole we were in, I did a lot of hard inner work, and slowly but surely built a ladder for our business. A big part of that involved prioritizing rest, both as individual workers and as a business. We said no to things that weren’t in alignment, because we knew that a short-term cash flow wouldn't be worth the long-term setbacks in team morale. We evaluated and reevaluated our skills and looked to see where the intersection of money and values showed up for us in the market, then we seized the opportunities that were meant for us.

One of the things that saved New Coyote was that when money was lacking, we cut executive pay without ever making cuts to staff pay, so we didn’t lose the crucial support we needed to keep the business afloat. And after we’d done our absolute best, we didn’t grind our wheels to dust fretting; instead, we went home and got some rest so we could start again bright and sharp the next day. We did everything in our power to preserve our physical and emotional health, over and above the business’ health.

As a team, we do great work and have a wide range of talents, but we also know that when we’re tired, burnt out or sick, the product that makes us special suffers. And that takes away our edge, which is our ability to show up for our clients with our full selves.

Investing in ourselves and adhering to our people-first principles has paid huge dividends for us. It kept our heads above water when we were really in danger, and turned 2022 into another profitable year despite a horrifically bad first quarter and a regular-bad second quarter. I feel more confident than ever that we have the sturdy base we need to thrive and grow in 2023 and beyond.

As I look around the industry right now, I see other business owners trying to utilize the same dogmatism that turns into toxic productivity—AKA the uncontrollable need to feel productive at all times, at any cost—which ultimately turns into burnout. Sometimes setting a big strict boundary around your time is helpful, but other times it’s not. The true gift of anticapitalism and healthy productivity is that the thing that’s right for you to do is entirely dependent on you and your context, and those things change hour to hour, day to day.

One of the most memorable things the poignant Audre Lorde told us is: “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” Things like capitalism, racism, white-centered norms, respectability politics, and the hoarding of power are all tools of the master and fundamental values upon which most modern workplaces were founded. Dogmatic adherence to a set of rules—whether imposed from outside sources (an oppressive society), or from within, by a psyche shaped by that oppression—is not going to bring us into self-actualized liberation.

What we need is to listen to our bodies and leverage our resources for our own continued healing, so we can step into our roles as truth tellers, disruptors, and anti-capitalist change-makers.

Thank you for joining me on this adventure - I’m looking forward to seeing what year three has in store.

In Solidarity,

Marina Martinez-Bateman  
CEO, New Coyote Consulting
