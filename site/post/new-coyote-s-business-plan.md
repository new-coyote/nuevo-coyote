**A successful day at the business is a day where we:**

* Work 6 hours or less in a manner that is body-led,
* Take breaks for breakfast, lunch and snacks
* Take a walk and/or a restful nap
* Have a meaningful conversation with another human that makes us feel good
* After we are taken care of and feeling abundant, make someone’s day better through empowerment, development, or the lessening of a burden

**We make money by:**

* Having a superior product that generates referrals
* Talking about our passion for connecting people with like-minded business owners and workers (in 1 on 1s, through content, and other ways)
* Retaining clients and growing the products they have with us
* Firing mismatched clients so they can thrive somewhere else

**We save money by:**

* Retaining employees by not working people into burnout
* Having a healthy onboarding process, with retraining and a culture of accountability so our product feels the same every day
* Firing mismatched employees quickly so they can thrive somewhere else
* Promoting from within so that we retain and grow institutional knowledge
* Avoiding working people into health crises potentially leading to lower health insurance costs
* If we have an office (I don’t think we will, but just in case) working less hours will lead to lower utility bills and less wear and tear on equipment
* Taking advantage of programs that benefit progressive businesses.
* Being entirely transparent with salaries and negotiations and not wasting time trying to get more out of someone than we pay them for
* Keeping meeting hours to an absolute minimum with as few people as possible, then disseminate the meeting info widely to avoid time drain

**We measure our success with:**

* How many employees are meeting their personal financial goals (buying a house, starting their own business, financing education or travel, growing their family)
* How many people were promoted or met their personal career goals
* How many employees built their credentials (certifications, public speaking, articles published, etc.)
* How much money our clients made
* How much money we were able to put back into the local economy (related to client income)
* How many more people we were able to bring in, both in terms of becoming clients, but also in terms of becoming staff, vendors, connections, etc.
