Empathy is one of the soft skills that so often make or break a leader, and is so rarely taught or talked about in professional development. Some believe that it can't be taught. However, it can be developed and there are lots of techniques we can learn and use to access our empathy as leaders. 

In this course you will:

* Learn how to use collaborative problem solving in the workplace
* Familiarize yourself with multiple review processes and theories in order to choose the best one for your department
* Develop your personal management style 
* Practice direct, clear and kind communication 

Intermediate and ongoing practice courses also available.
