In order to thrive on this planet, we must do what we can to dismantle capitalism and decolonize our systems, and in order to do that, we need new skills for leadership and management. 

If you feel like there must be better ways to manage people and reach your organizational goals without burning them out or contributing to the harm we're already experiencing at the hands of late-stage capitalism, then Decolonizing Management is for you. This is one of the few management training courses focused entirely on human-centered, anti-capitalist systems that is also taught by an experienced manager and mission-driven communicator.

This 12-week course dives deep into the fundamentals of management, from budgeting to change management, with the understanding that hierarchies of dominance do not create environments that allow us to thrive, either as individuals or as a team. Learn alternative strategies and new ways of operating, based on ancestral practices, to decolonize yourself and your workplace.

I work with Organizations in order to provide Decolonizing Management to their staff in a conscientious, flexible, and tailored way.

## Testimonials

"Before taking New Coyote's Decolonizing Management course, I often felt in over my head and relied on management styles I’d observed without understanding why they worked. The course shifted my view of leadership from 'taking care' of people and holding them accountable to empowering them to do their best — while still offering support and accountability in values-aligned ways.

Marina’s warm, insightful, and gently challenging facilitation helped me recognize how my own tendencies toward overachieving and people-pleasing shaped my view of success. They created a space where we weren’t performing for approval but learning for ourselves, which was transformative.

The cohort conversations were just as valuable, shaping each session and offering perspectives from people in both similar and very different roles.

Anyone who manages — or thinks they already know what good management looks like — needs this course. It grounded my leadership in values, intention, and care."

**Emily Teixera of Politisit**

"I have the pleasure of participating in New Coyote's decolonizing management training, and it was amazing! I am a consultant who works with managers, directors, and executives. I offer coaching and have applied the knowledge I've gained from attending this training. I've also grown my own knowledge from this series, and Marina created resources we can use long after the training. Their series also lends itself to networking with other participants about the work they are doing. It is an eye-opening and deeply knowledgeable training, and I highly recommend it." 

**Sidney Morgan of Red Sea Road Consulting**

"I took the first version of this course when it was housed by The People's Nonprofit Accelerator, and I am so excited to see Marina expand on that groundwork and really make this course their own. My cohort and I learned about alternative organizational structures, hiring and firing, performance improvement plans and more through a decolonized community-centric lens. It doesn't hurt that Marina is down to earth and so fun to be around and learn from! This is a course for anyone looking to make radical changes in how we do leadership."

**Nel Taylor of Now This Consulting**

"I took this course with Marina last fall and got a lot out of it. I boosted my new local network and learned a lot about management and new perspectives on problem solving. If you are interested, check this course out."

**Zackary Pacholl of Youth ERA**

"I've taken trainings with Marina Martinez-Bateman in the past and they have been remarkable. For starters, their courses are not hierarchical. They set the value and tone we all teach and learn from one another. A practical technique I still use after 3 years is when I am overwhelmed with tasks, I take a sticky note and write down the top 3-4 things I need to accomplish that day. It really grounds me.

I'm certain you will learn SO MANY skills and insights to be a revolutionary manager."

**Camerina Galván of Galván Consulting**

"I took a similar class with Marina last year and I recommend this!"

**Heather Harteis of Rational Unicorn**
