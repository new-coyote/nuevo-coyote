Nonprofit Anonymous was originally presented as a breakout session at the 2021 WVDO Regional Conference, and adapted as a workshop session (Tech Policies for Reducing Toxic Productivity) for the 2022 NTEN Conference. 

This training workshop can be tailored to address the specific needs and concerns of your organization's employees or members.

## About The Presentation

“I worked 17 hours every day last week!”

“I don’t sleep.”

“I’ll take a walk when this is done.” \[Narrator: It’s been 5 years since she said that.\]

How many times have you heard or said something like the statement’s above? Working in nonprofits can be extremely rewarding, seeing and being the change we want in the world is priceless. However, so many of us come from backgrounds where we or our work (or both) were undervalued, and as a result we carry this into the workplace and can be doing more harm than good. Both to ourselves and our missions.

In order to fully serve our and our organizations vision for the future, we’ve got to make some changes to how we serve ourselves. In this workshop, we’ll talk about how to do that.

Learning Objectives:

1\. Recognize when we’re harming ourselves at the expense of the mission  
2\. Start a dialogue with ourselves to help us journey into healing  
3\. Know how to identify harmful behavior before it takes over our culture
