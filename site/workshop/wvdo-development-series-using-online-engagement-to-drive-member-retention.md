WVDO's Development Series are workshops taught by local luminaries, covering hot topics in fundraising. Designed for professionals new to fundraising, they are also useful for experienced fundraisers branching out into new areas.

The presentation will start with techniques for gathering and interpreting member feedback as a means to determine member needs, which is the first step to providing benefits online.

Then we’ll talk about building community online, how to be consistent when there’s not a lot of time, and how to meet member needs on a budget.

After that, we will talk about several of the most popular tools and how to use them with your membership.
