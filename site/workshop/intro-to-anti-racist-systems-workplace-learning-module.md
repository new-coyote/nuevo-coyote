After beginning an equity journey, many organizations find their old ways of doing things don't line up with their current vision, but can't see a way to move forward. Some people think our current traditional hierarchical structure is the only structure, the best one, or even the natural way of things. Others know it's not great, but don't know what the alternatives are, or they think that the alternative is no structure at all.

Even for committed anti-racist orgs, there is a huge knowledge gap when it comes to anti-racist systems in theory and practice. Intro to Anti-Racist Systems is a true intro course to set your organization on the path towards imagining something more.

This course helps employees/members of your organization put our current working systems into context as a product of capitalist colonialism, and understand that Indigenous and BIPOC systems have existed, still exist today, and are evolving to exist in the future.

**Key Takeaways:**

* The opposite of oppressive systems is not a lack of systems
* Examples of alternate systems: pros and cons
* Techniques and best practices for envisioning and managing systems change

Intro to Anti-Racist Systems is the first in a three-part series on anti-racist systems. [Part 2](https://newcoyote.com/workshop/systems-for-working-in-an-anti-racist-paradigm-intermediate-course/) provides more detail on the systems themselves, while Part 3 is specifically for work teams that are practicing alternative systems and have specific questions regarding their unique circumstances.
