In order to thrive on this planet, we must do what we can to dismantle capitalism and decolonize our systems, and in order to do that, we need new skills for leadership and management. 

If you feel like there must be better ways to manage people and reach your organizational goals without burning them out or contributing to the harm we're already experiencing at the hands of late-stage capitalism, then Decolonizing Management is for you. This is one of the few management training courses focused entirely on human-centered, anti-capitalist systems that is also taught by an experienced manager and mission-driven communicator.

This 12-week course dives deep into the fundamentals of management, from budgeting to change management, with the understanding that hierarchies of dominance do not create environments that allow us to thrive, either as individuals or as a team. Learn alternative strategies and new ways of operating, based on ancestral practices, to decolonize yourself and your workplace.

Decolonizing Management has a Spring session and a Summer session. The next session takes place from March 5 to May 21, 2025. [Sign up now](https://decolonizing.management/) to save your spot!

## Testimonials

"I took the first version of this course when it was housed by The People's Nonprofit Accelerator, and I am so excited to see Marina expand on that groundwork and really make this course their own. My cohort and I learned about alternative organizational structures, hiring and firing, performance improvement plans and more through a decolonized community-centric lens. It doesn't hurt that Marina is down to earth and so fun to be around and learn from! This is a course for anyone looking to make radical changes in how we do leadership."

**Nel Taylor of Now This Consulting**

"I took this course with Marina last fall and got a lot out of it. I boosted my new local network and learned a lot about management and new perspectives on problem solving. If you are interested, check this course out."

**Zackary Pacholl of Youth ERA**

"I've taken trainings with Marina Martinez-Bateman in the past and they have been remarkable. For starters, their courses are not hierarchical. They set the value and tone we all teach and learn from one another. A practical technique I still use after 3 years is when I am overwhelmed with tasks, I take a sticky note and write down the top 3-4 things I need to accomplish that day. It really grounds me.

I'm certain you will learn SO MANY skills and insights to be a revolutionary manager."

**Camerina Galván of Galván Consulting**

"I took a similar class with Marina last year and I recommend this!"

**Heather Harteis of Rational Unicorn**
