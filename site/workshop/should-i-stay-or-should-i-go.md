Should I Stay or Should I Go? was originally presented as a breakout session at the 2022 WVDO Regional Conference.

This training workshop can be tailored to address the specific needs and concerns of your organization's employees or members.

## About The Presentation

Most of the time, we work where we do because we believe in the mission and we know that our skills can help fulfill that mission. But sometimes, we have to ask ourselves, am I really doing the most good where I am? Old fashioned leadership, broken systems, and/or plain old barriers to resources can lead us to wonder if we should stay where we are, or go somewhere else. It’s rarely, if ever, an easy decision.

In this workshop we will talk about how to take an inventory of your assets, including what’s working and what isn’t working in your current position. Along with that, we’ll talk about how to determine what we have the most potential to change, and how to make a decision based on love of self and personal values. At the end of the workshop, attendees will have a map of how to begin the next phase of their career: either by staying and fighting for the change they need, or leaving to have meaningful impact somewhere else.

This workshop is for nonprofit staff, volunteers, board members, and anyone who is working in a mission-driven position and looking for help deciding on their next steps.

### Key Learning Objective(s)

1\. Take inventory of what is and isn’t working, as well as any assets they have in their current position
