WVDO's Development Series are workshops taught by local luminaries, covering hot topics in fundraising. Designed for professionals new to fundraising, they are also useful for experienced fundraisers branching out into new areas.

## Workshop Description

The presentation will start with techniques for gathering and interpreting member feedback as a means to determine member needs, which is the first step to providing benefits online. Then we’ll talk about building community online, how to be consistent when there’s not a lot of time, and how to meet member needs on a budget. After that, we will talk about several of the most popular tools and how to use them with your membership. Every section will have a short presentation followed by Q&A with a last review and Q&A at the end if we have time.

## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this presentation, attendees should:  
1) Know how to identify their members' needs  
2) Build programming that responds to those needs and drives retention  
3) Be familiar with several online platforms they can use and the benefits and the costs of each of them
