      to create change and captivate audiences. Our journalistic approach deeply
      regards the subject's unique character, perspective and voice. The
      long-term goal of this practice is one of community impact: building a
      wealth of generational wisdom that can support us all in pursuing our
      dreams."

      This framework enables our team to understand problems relating to equity,
      diversity, and inclusion so they can be addressed and learned from. If you
      need help navigating challenges in leadership and if intersectionality,
      empathy, and curiosity resonate with you, you've come to the right place.

    Marina Martinez-Bateman from New Coyote, Zhou Fang from Intersectional
    Group, and Eliana Mendez from Human Centric Media are offering two months of
    leadership training tailored to your organization, your staff, your context
    and designed to give you exactly what you need to succeed and avoid ruin in
    today's ever-changing landscape. One of the things I hear over and over is
    that clients have been looking for someone like me for years and getting
    performative bullshit that doesn't address the real-world issues facing
    their staff, doesn’t reflect the values of the organization or the
    communities they serve, makes staff feel overwhelmed and undervalued, or all
    of the above. We are three experienced professionals who will design a
    training program and media package that gives you exactly what you need and
    nothing more. Reply to this email and tell me what issues you wish you could
    resolve in just 60 days, and I’ll tell you how our training can help you do
    that. 
     

    We use an equity-centered and trauma-informed approach in Leadership work. 


    The guiding light of our work is the Intersectionality Framework, Human-centered, and Joy-oriented. We believe that leadership is about human connections, as well as community support. 


    Under these guiding principles, we lead our work with empathy, compassion, intentionality, curiosity, hope, joy, and love.


    We pride ourselves in working with organizations and communities that support higher education, women in leadership, housing, people and culture, community development, environmental justice, gender justice, etc. 


    Our training and coaching centers intersectionality, intersectional identities, thoughtful communications, (re)building trust, civic engagement, unlearning dated and harmful information, healing and restoration, etc.


    Along with mentorship, our program includes a headshot session, a vertical video interview for each member of the cohort, and a group portrait for posterity.


    Our two month training cycle includes:


    Monthly training for your team, in person or virtual. 


    One-on-one coaching, in person or virtual, 

    for the leadership team.

    portrait to honor the experience.
