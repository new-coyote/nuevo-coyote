      to create change and captivate audiences. Our journalistic approach deeply
      regards the subject's unique character, perspective and voice. The
      long-term goal of this practice is one of community impact: building a
      wealth of generational wisdom that can support us all in pursuing our
      dreams."

    description: The lens of intersectionality that guides our work sets us apart.
      This framework enables our team to understand problems relating to equity,
      diversity, and inclusion so they can be addressed and learned from. If you
      need help navigating challenges in leadership and if intersectionality,
      empathy, and curiosity resonate with you, you've come to the right place.
