"Through our group discussion I was able to examine my coping skills with a kind eye and think about when and why they developed, how they serve me, and ways in which I'd like to grow. Marina creates a welcoming environment that directly reflects the specific group involved, and what they'd like to address. I know the stories shared and practical tips offered in our session will help sustain my decolonizing practice (both personally and in work), and for that I'm grateful!" Emmy Eao, IPRC

This workshop is discussion-based— and a choose your own adventure tailored to what the group is most drawn towards talking about, whether it’s history & context or tangible ways to unravel the origins of self-worth related to productivity. The experience has proven to be a great springboard for continuing self-reflective work towards uncoupling my creative process and self-worth from toxic productivity." Harper Quinn, IPRC
