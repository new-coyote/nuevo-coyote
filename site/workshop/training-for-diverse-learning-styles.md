Training for Diverse Learning Styles: 45 Minutes at  Time was originally presented as a 30-minute session at the 2023 NTEN Conference, 23NTC.

This training workshop can be tailored to address the specific needs and concerns of your organization's employees or members.

### About The Presentation

More and more, we talk about training for different learning styles. Tactile learners need movement and action, people who process audibly need discussion, neurodiverse and neurotypical people have different, and sometimes seemingly conflicting needs as well.

In this 30 minute session, we will talk about how to make trainings expansively accessible while still being efficient and effective. Help people retain vital information in a way that affirms them, meets them where they are, and gives the agency back to the trainees.

#### First learning outcome

Diverse learning styles call for responsive and accessible trainings

#### Second learning outcome

Providing options for attendees to self-regulate is better than controlling all the outcomes

#### Third learning outcome

People learn best in environments where they can be safe and comfortable
