We will be planning our next month via Zoom meeting, starting with an assessment of our priorities and major events and backwards calendaring in the time we need to make sure we meet our goals while considering the volatile nature of planning when things are uncertain. We'll be focusing on what we can do, assessing our risk tolerance, and talking about how to make our planner a safe place, even when scary things are happening in the wider world.

Come prepared with your priorities and major events, your planner, pens, stickers and whatever else makes planning fun for you.

Tickets start at $5 because we've found that people are more likely to attend events they pay for. Tickets support the facilitator's labor and go to buy gift cards, which will be raffled off during the event. If $5 is a hardship or you, email marina@letteromatic.com and they will add you for free.

This is an online meeting. At this time we have no ability to do live captioning, but we are working on making this as accessible as possible and will update this section as we try different solutions.
