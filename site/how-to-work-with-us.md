  content: "**New Coyote is rolling out a new roadmap on how to engage with us.**\n\nBecause
    of our high level of commitment to values like **workers’ rights, equity, and
    anti-racism**, and because we are unapologetically **pro-trans, pro-sex worker,
    and anticapitalist**, we’re very deliberate about who we work with. Until recently,
    we’ve acquired clients through friends and word of mouth, and that’s worked out
    for us. We’ve very rarely worked for anyone who we didn’t feel represented our
    values.   \n   \n Now that we’re growing, this way of working feels too conservative
    and too cautious. We know there are more organizations out there looking for consultants
    who speak and work like we do, who can support their vision and align on core
    values and beliefs.   \n   \n We now have a clear path to working together for
    anyone who is interested in finding out what an anti-racist, anti-capitalist organization
    can do for them. \n\n**WHO**\n\n**Marginalized leaders**, specifically leaders
    of color and/or queer people in leadership tend to be the best fit for our style
    of working. If you’re invested in liberation, anti-capitalism, and anti-racism;
    if you’re changing your lens away from the traditionalist, white supremacist “professionalism;”
    if you are ready to create change both for yourself and for your community: we’re
    the right place for you. \n\n**WHAT**\n\n**The New Coyote process starts with
    coaching.** In coaching we have two monthly meetings where I work directly with
    you on what you’re experiencing, what your plans are, and what your needs are.
    You also have a number to text me in between meetings with various questions or
    updates. Together, we identify what you can do with what you have in the moment,
    how to achieve your goals, and how to work ethically to foster liberation for
    ourselves and others.   \n   \n In coaching, **we’ll work out where New Coyote
    fits in your leadership goals**, and where we can provide for the needs of your
    team. We’ll agree on a plan, then **New Coyote will train your staff** before
    we start working together so that we’re all on the same page. After that, we’ll
    **follow the plan** we agreed on to help your organization with whatever you need,
    including communications, marketing, fundraising, management restructuring, hiring/firing,
    etc.   \n   \n While we work together, we can continue coaching, transfer the
    coaching to another leader in your team, or pause coaching.   \n   \n A client
    doesn’t need to move on to training and technical assistance - you can stay with
    coaching indefinitely - but a client does need to start with coaching in order
    to do deeper work with us.   \n   \n Over the last three years, we’ve learned
    that **so many of the issues our clients were struggling with could be resolved
    in one hour of structured coaching** that focused on how to uphold their anticapitalist
    and anti-racist values while still operating inside of a white supremacist environment
    that is endemic to capitalism. We also learned that our busy clients required
    a flexible coaching schedule, and an easy way to contact me when they were in
    the thick of it. Two meetings a month and a text line seem to be the perfect combination.
    \n\n**HOW**\n\nIf this path to working with us appeals to you, **book a coaching
    assessment today** via our [Calendly link](https://marinaforhire.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=08d9c04fab21756309c2c31e8&id=588457046d&e=64ec745402)
    or contact us [here](https://newcoyote.com/contact/)!  \n  \n If you know anyone
    in activism and leadership, especially if they are a person of color and/or a
    queer person who is focused on liberation for themselves and others, please forward
    this to them or email-introduce us to each other.   \n  \n We want to engage in
    our own growth with as much intention and as little harm as possible. Being sure
    we can serve people before we commit ourselves to working with them is one way
    we intend to create the wealth we need to invest in our workers and our values
    without being extractive or taking more than we give back."
