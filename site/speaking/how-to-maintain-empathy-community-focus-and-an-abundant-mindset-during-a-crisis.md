      as WVDO) is to serve people raising funds for nonprofit organizations by
      linking them with others in the development community and providing
      affordable opportunities for their professional growth and education. They
      envision a future where all people work together to dismantle the systems
      that profit from the oppression of ourselves and others, centering the
      wisdom and leadership of those who are most affected by those oppressive
      systems.
