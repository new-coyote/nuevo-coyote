    description: The Home-Based Business Association is not a “leads group,” but
      they do network with each other to get ideas about how to work better,
      smarter, more profitably. They enjoy the camaraderie, and the chance to
      get out among others who do what we do — and to dine together once a
      month, while enjoying an interesting and useful program.

Building a Business Association for Freelancers was originally presented as a facilitated workshop for the Association of Home Businesses.

## About The Presentation

February’s dinner meeting of the Association of Home Businesses introduces you to “The Freelancer” – today’s most common home businessperson; the speaker is Marina Martinez-Bateman.

A guided conversation asks the question: “Can we use Portland’s robust neighborhood business association culture to benefit freelancers and other home-based businesses?”

As a former freelancer, former business association board member, and the owner of a home-based business, Marina has a unique insight into the overlapping interests and needs of freelancers – needs that most traditional business associations struggle to serve.
