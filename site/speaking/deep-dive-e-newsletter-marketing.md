Deep Dive: E-Newsletter Marketing was originally presented at the 2023 Travel Portland Partner Summit.



This training workshop can be tailored to address the specific needs and concerns of your organization’s employees or members.



## About the Presentation

Learn how to gain subscribers, gather content and deliver e-newsletters on a regular, reliable and achievable schedule. You’ll walk away with an e-newsletter schedule and the tools to implement it. Bring a laptop and any logos, graphics or color hex codes to start building your own newsletter (and if you don’t know what a color hex code is — that will be covered too!).
