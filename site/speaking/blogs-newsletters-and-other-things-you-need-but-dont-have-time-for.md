## About The Presentation

"I need a newsletter. I need to get a blog post up!" How many times have you said that this year? If it’s more than one and you still don’t have a post up or a newsletter out, this workshop is for you! We’ll talk with web content expert and 20-year copywriting veteran Marina Martinez-Bateman about how to take the pain out of publishing yourself, how to determine if it is time to hire someone else to do it for you, and how to get the most out of that relationship once you do hire.
