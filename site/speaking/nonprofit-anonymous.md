  - description: The mission of The People’s Nonprofit Accelerator (formerly known
      as WVDO) is to serve people raising funds for nonprofit organizations by
      linking them with others in the development community and providing
      affordable opportunities for their professional growth and education. They
      envision a future where all people work together to dismantle the systems
      that profit from the oppression of ourselves and others, centering the
      wisdom and leadership of those who are most affected by those oppressive
      systems.

Nonprofit Anonymous was originally presented as a breakout session at the 2021 WVDO Regional Conference.



This training workshop can be tailored to address the specific needs and concerns of your organization’s employees or members.



## About The Presentation

“I worked 17 hours every day last week!”



“I don’t sleep.”



“I’ll take a walk when this is done.” \[Narrator: It’s been 5 years since she said that.]



How many times have you heard or said something like the statement’s above? Working in nonprofits can be extremely rewarding, seeing and being the change we want in the world is priceless. However, so many of us come from backgrounds where we or our work (or both) were undervalued, and as a result we carry this into the workplace and can be doing more harm than good. Both to ourselves and our missions.



In order to fully serve our and our organizations vision for the future, we’ve got to make some changes to how we serve ourselves. In this workshop, we’ll talk about how to do that.



## Learning Objectives:



1. Recognize when we’re harming ourselves at the expense of the mission

2. Start a dialogue with ourselves to help us journey into healing

3. Know how to identify harmful behavior before it takes over our culture
