  content: "## Hi, I'm Marina and I'm the CEO of New Coyote Consulting.\n\nI'm the
    person you'll be working with on assessments, consulting, coaching and training.
    New Coyote is my brain child, and is born of many years' experience applying equity
    and human-centered systems to communications strategy. I built it to be a new
    kind of company, a place that puts human beings over performative capitalist expectations
    that only waste time, lead to burn out, and don't make any money for a middle
    class company like mine. \n\nI'm a serial entrepreneur and a grassroots communicator
    with more than 20 years' experience motivating people to take action on behalf
    of political, cultural, and commercial interests. I take my commitment to the
    people I communicate with very seriously. My ongoing equity and workers' rights
    practice has made me a popular speaker, trainer, and peer mentor in the industry.
    \n\nI have successfully created, consulted on, planned, and launched multiple
    businesses and projects that make money without sacrificing principals or values.
    My success in business is directly tied to my lived experience and those of my
    ancestors, who live on through me. \n\nI come from a family of atheist communist
    activists on the one side, and marine corps veterans on the other. Along the way,
    we experienced and passed down generational trauma, abuse, mental illness, and
    addiction. My identity as a queer, non-binary, disabled Latine (Latinx, Latin@,
    Latina/o) person informs my sense of place in this world. My family history and
    personal experiences of racism, sexism, oppression, transphobia, and ablism in
    and out of the workplace fuel my need for justice. The work of anti-racism, decolonization,
    and recovery from the trauma of capitalism is a life-long journey and it's been
    my daily practice to do my part in this generational work for more than 21 years.\n\nI
    deeply believe and operate from the belief that until and unless we pay people
    a living wage, bringing marginalized people in line not only with earning, but
    with wealth generation available to historically privileged populations, we have
    no hope of a sustainable movement. \n\nLiberation and prosperity go hand in hand.
    Wealth generation for communities of color and communities kept in poverty by
    white supremacy, especially Black and Indigenous communities will change the world.
    I invest in pay equity and resource development for BIPOC and trans people first
    and foremost.\n\nYou can learn more about me on my personal website [www.marinaforhire.com,](http://www.marinaforhire.com,)
    my twitter @marinaforhire, or on Linkedin where I post videos every week on Monday
    and Thursday setting out my intentions for the week and then updating everyone
    on how I did on those intentions. "
